In this assignment I worked on two differetn things.
I worked on page.c and the Benchmarking, I did both with Daniel, the group worked on the design team 

For Benchmarking:
 we install the the stresser program and read the manual on how to use it.
 We made sure that everything that is need to be printed out is where it needs to be. Both in the original file and our modified one. We ran the stresser with 3Gb for 10 seconds. We did that becuase we wanted to give enough time to work the system.
We took did this test several times, each time restarting the machine and running the stresser program. Once we have collected several samples we created the graphs to see the differences.


For page.c
we first wanted to see what is going on in the file, what is the purppous of each function and where we should start modifiying the file. We found out where to insert the random values from 1-32. Once we did that we also found that inside that very same file is where we are moving the pages to the front of the active listed rather than the rear.

 For design page.
Since me and Daniel worked on one part of the assignment and Nithin and Leon worked on another part we all worke on the designed doc understanding what each of us did.
