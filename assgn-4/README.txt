Daniel and I tried to understand how the system calls are being created and used, to be more speficic, we attempted to implement the setkey sys call.There were three files that are used to use the system calls: syscalls.master, vfs_syscalls.c and capabablilites.conf
Also,Daniel and I worrked on understandding using the AES encryption algorithm and how to use the AES code which was given in our assignment. We used the functions AES128_ECB_encrypt and AES128_ECB_decrypt.
