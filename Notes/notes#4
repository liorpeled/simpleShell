Memory hierarchy

What is the memory hierarchy?
Different levels of memory
Some are small and fast
Others are large and slow

What levels are usually included?
Cache: samll amount of fast, expenisve memory
L1 cache: usually on the CPU chip



Basic memory management
Componentes include
Operating system
Single process
Goal: lay these out in memory
Memory protection may not be an issue (only one program)
Flexibility may still be useful (allow OS changes, etc)
No swapping or paging 

Fixed partitions: Multiple programs
Fixed memory partitions
Divide memory into fixed spaces
Assign a process to a space when it’s free
Mechanisms
Separate input quaues


…..


Several memory parititons
Lots of processes wanting to use the cpu

Tradeoff
	More processes utilize the cpu better
	Fewer processes use less memory

Modeling mutliprogramming
More IO/ wa t means less processor utilization
A
This means that the OS should have more processes if they are I/O bound




Keep track of free/ allocated memory regions with a linked list
	Each entry in the list corresponds to a contiguous region of memory
Entry can indicated either allocated or free
May have separate lists for free and allocated areas



Basic idea


Program uses virtual addresses
	Addresses loCAL TO THE PROCESS
